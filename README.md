# Smart Crop Monitoring and Irrigation System

## Introduction
This project is a smart crop monitoring and irrigation system designed to help farmers optimize water usage by analyzing environmental data. It leverages IoT sensors to gather real-time data, such as temperature, humidity, crop height, and light levels, to determine the best times to irrigate crops. The system provides data-driven recommendations based on customizable thresholds and trends.

The project includes:
- Code for interfacing with sensors (DHT11, photoresistor, etc.).
- A Python-based web application that allows users to upload CSV files of sensor data and receive irrigation recommendations.
